# Learning-ShoeSizeConverterApp
This is the 2nd app made following along the iOS8 and Swift Course

The class is with bitfountain.io and all code and concepts are derived from their lessons. I may have enhanced the code with my own flavor, but basically the same.

This public repository is for my teacher to check my code if needed.
